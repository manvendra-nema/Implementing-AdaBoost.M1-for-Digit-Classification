# Implementing-AdaBoost.M1-for-Digit-Classification
Classify digits 0 and 1, labeled as -1 and 1. Implement AdaBoost.M1 with PCA for dimensionality reduction, and decision stumps as weak classifiers. Follow a structured approach including data division, weight updates, and accuracy evaluation. Explore the impact of boosting on classification accuracy through visualizations and detailed analysis.
